# Sales-Excel-Dashboard
Developed a comprehensive sales dashboard for the Big Fashion Group using Excel, incorporating interactive visualizations to analyze sales performance across multiple dimensions. The dashboard provides insights into sales trends over time, geographic distribution by state, category-wise revenue contribution, and performance of different retail chains and managers. Advanced Excel features such as pivot tables, slicers, and dynamic charts were utilized to enable easy data exploration. The dashboard helps stakeholders identify high-performing regions, optimize inventory management, and develop data-driven sales strategies.
